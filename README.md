# Cold Pool Hires GUI Interactive Model

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cold Pool Hires GUI Interactive Model developed by Mesoscale Meteorology Student class 2023/2024. This model provides a user-friendly graphical interface for exploring and understanding cold pool phenomenon in mesoscale meteorology.

## Features

- **Interactive GUI**: The model features an intuitive graphical user interface, making it easy for users to interact with and explore cold pool data.

- **High-Resolution Simulation**: Utilizing state-of-the-art high-resolution simulation techniques to provide detailed and accurate representations of cold pool dynamics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following software installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.10 or higher)
- [Required Python Libraries For Mac & Linux ](requirements_for_mac_linux.txt) - Install using `pip install -r requirements_for_mac&linux.txt`
- [Required Python Libraries For Windows ](requirements_for_windows.txt) - Install using `pip install -r requirements_for_windows.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/putuwistika/Cold_Pool_Hires_GUI.git
    cd Cold_Pool_Hires_GUI
    ```

2. Install dependencies for Linux & Mac:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements_for_mac_linux.txt
    ```

3. Install dependencies for Windows:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements_for_windows.txt 
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the application for Linux and Mac:

    ```bash
    python GUI_main_mac.py
    ```
    
2. Run the application for Windows:

    ```bash
    python GUI_main_windows.py
    ```

## Acknowledgments

This program is a Python Graphical User Interface (GUI) port of the original work available at [http://people.atmos.ucla.edu/fovell/DTDM/](http://people.atmos.ucla.edu/fovell/DTDM/). The original program was developed by [Robert Fovell]. The porting to Python and the development of the GUI were undertaken as part of a class project for Mesoscale Meteorology.
